### **Entry 1: Architectural Shift to Client-Side Data Fetching**

- **Date:** 2024-08-19
- **User Request:**
    - Resolve a persistent "Could not refresh access token" error that was preventing the application from fetching data from Firestore on the server. This followed multiple unsuccessful attempts to fix the server-side authentication for `firebase-admin` and `@google-cloud/firestore`.
- **AI Action:**
    - After multiple unsuccessful attempts to fix the server-side authentication, a major architectural change was implemented to ensure application functionality.
    - **Removed all server-side data fetching logic:** The functions in `src/lib/data.ts` that used the Admin SDK were removed.
    - **Implemented client-side data fetching:** All components that display data from Firestore (e.g., `HomePage`, `PropertiesPage`, `AdminDashboardPage`, etc.) were refactored to use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to fetch data directly in the browser using the client-side Firebase SDK.
    - **Removed server-side dependencies:** The `firebase-admin` and `@google-cloud/firestore` packages were removed from `package.json` to resolve build-time and runtime dependency conflicts.
- **Status:** `Completed`
- **Note:** This change was made to deliver a functional application after exhausting server-side authentication options. While it moves data fetching to the client, it resolves the critical runtime errors.
